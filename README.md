# Orange OS LE Install Script

The name says it all, a install script for the [Orange OS Linux Edition](https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/620114/) OS!

How to install:
Download and boot the arch linux ISO, then run
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaeleldar/Orange_OS_LE_Install_Script/master/script_part_1.py > install.py
python3 install.py
```
Then answer the questions and you have arch linux... yes you read that right. As of now, it only installs arch linux, but soon it will also install the packages and files for Orange OS LE.
