# Orange OS LE CLI Install Script

The name says it all, a install script for the [Orange OS Linux Edition](https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/620114/) OS!

A GUI install system is coming soon, but for now, this is your only option.

## How to install:

Download and boot an [Arch linux ISO](https://archlinux.org/download/), then in the live enviroment, run

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaeleldar/Orange_OS_LE_Install_Script/bb91938b9289e1bcc8001a583708466c76c19a5d/script_part_1.py > install.py
python3 install.py
```

Then answer the questions and Orange OS LE 0.1.0. Note, that this isn't the final release and a lot is missing.
